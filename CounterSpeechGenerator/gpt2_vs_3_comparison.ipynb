History is replete with almost every culture and nation having slaves when they were the victors, or the strongest. Slavery is not unique to Africans, nor unique to the United States. For centuries Muslim countries on the Mediterranean Sea dealt in huge slave trades. Many of those slaves were white. Conquered nations routinely were turned into slaves. It is a very ugly and shameful history of most of humanity. Ugly or not it shouldn’t be swept under the carpet and forgotten. That is how history repeats itself. I understand why Confederate statues can be construed as offensive. They represent a sordid and brutal past that no American today should think well of. There should be no honoring of the institution of slavery, ever. The Civil War was not just about slavery. It was about a country being torn apart by a divisive and growing cancer of malcontent. It was about saving the better angels of our nation’s great founding principles. It was about preserving our future and not letting it dissipate into a mere shell of its potential. 600,000 soldiers died in that war. And who knows how many civilians?

       " 6: {'Hatespeech': 'democrat: Susan B. Anthony was born 200 years ago in a country where few women or people of color dared to give political speeches on public platforms and that had no national voting rights for women. Both straight and queer women were often pressured into marriage when it was against their wishes. Women who did manage to remain single – or who formed partnerships with other women – were typically pitied or scorned. She worked tirelessly for most of her long life to demand racial and gender equality and her lesbian attractions only fueled her struggle against the patriarchal system she abhorred. Related: How lesbianism was turned into a problem a century ago Anthony was the mastermind – more than a hundred years before ACT UP – of a protest that had women storming polling places during the 1872 presidential election to insist they be allowed to vote. After the Civil War, African-American men had been granted the national right to vote to the exclusion of women. Anthony never married or had a serious relationship with a man. As a teenager, she prophetically confessed to her diary, in 1838, “I think any female would rather live and die an old maid.” She continued to make pronouncements that coyly hinted at her lesbian orientation. In an 1896 interview, she told the reporter, “I was very well as I was…I’m sure no man could have made me any happier than I have been.” When pressed by journalists, throughout her long life in the media spotlight, she stagecrafted a role for herself of not being able to find the right man. But the real reason she remained “single” was that her amorous desires and emotional needs were only fulfilled by women. The youthful lesbian orator Anna Dickinson, hailed as “America’s Joan of Arc” during the Civil War for rallying the war-weary Union forces to victory with her fiery speeches, became the target of Anthony’s affections in the 1860s. Dickinson was catapulted to national fame as the first woman to give a full-length political speech before Congress and her motto, which appeared on some of her publicity photos, was “The World belongs to those who take it.” Dickinson’s trailblazing achievements, acerbic wit, youthful queer energy and “handsome beauty” enraptured Anthony. Dickinson saved personal letters from Anthony that candidly indicate physical desire. Anthony flirtatiously describes her longing to spend time with the “naughty tease” Anna. ”I invite you to come to me here and sleep with me in my fourth story bed room at Mrs. Stanton’s ever so many nights,” she wrote.” To snuggle you darling closer than ever.” Anthony’s feelings of sensual anticipation reveal a woman who is very much flesh and blood. “Dear Dicky Darling…I have plain quarters…double bed – and big enough & good enough to take you in. I do so long for the scolding & pinched ears & every thing I know awaits me.” The relationship cooled off by the early 1870s. Dickinson would go on to have a series of girlfriends over the years and finally settled into a 30+ year relationship with a married woman, Sallie Ackley. The rather bemused Mr. Ackley didn’t seem to mind the living arrangement. But Anthony retained a maternal or sisterly affection for the younger Dickinson and kept mentioning her in interviews, as the decades passed. Anthony even volunteered to help solicit funds for Dickinson when she fell on hard times. In a touching 1895 letter, Anthony wrote, “My Darling Anna…I’m awfully glad to know you still live…[no one] ever has or ever will fill the niche in my heart that you did–my dear.” The theme of wistful reminiscence characterizes another striking comment Susan B. Anthony made later in life when discussing her lesbian niece, Lucy Anthony. Lucy’s life-partner was the brilliant orator and activist Rev. Anna Howard Shaw, who eventually took over the presidency of the suffrage movement and expanded public support for it.

Anthony made later in life when discussing her lesbian niece, Lucy Anthony. Lucy’s life-partner was the brilliant orator and activist Rev. Anna Howard Shaw, who eventually took over the presidency of the suffrage movement and expanded public support for it. Susan wrote, ”I wanted what I feared I shouldn’t find, that is a young woman who would be to me–every way–what she [Lucy] is to the Rev. Anna Shaw.” Clearly, Susan B. Anthony was happy for her queer-blended extended family. It was “niece-in-law” Shaw who was Susan Anthony’s appointed spiritual heir, in one of the most moving and significant deathbed vigils of American “herstory.” Anthony drifted in and out of consciousness as the end drew near. Shaw tried her best to comfort the dying activist with a solemn promise to do everything in her power to get the vote. The scene was an emotional “last-rites” passing of the suffrage leadership torch, from one lesbian to another. Anthony’s only regret was that she hadn’t been able to sustain an enduring lesbian union like that of Lucy Anthony and Shaw. The two life-partners created homes together and lived together and were devoted to one another till Shaw’s death in 1919, as the country stood on the cusp of national woman suffrage. Anna Shaw kept her promise. Anthony did develop a passionate queer relationship, however, in her last years with Emily Gross, a married woman who lived in Chicago. They visited each other and traveled together. Anthony referred to Gross as her “lover.” Why have most historians straightwashed Anthony? Why has popular culture not fully acknowledged the de facto queer-straight alliance of women who worked in “open secrecy” in the gender revolution that was the suffrage movement? Many generally acknowledge the toxic dishonesty of white supremacy and male supremacy in historical writing. But straight supremacy, especially the erasure of queer human beings in pre-World War II historical commentary, is still prevalent. My husband and I visited Anthony’s house in Rochester, New York, last summer. I vigorously protested the dreary straightwashed tour of her life being presented, but was made to feel like a troublemaking queer in Anthony’s own home for challenging the guide and asking questions. “What difference does that make?!,” the tour guide snapped as she told me that the feminist icon was straight. I persevered and attempted to talk to the staff members who were there, all of whom seemed resistant and condescending. We left disheartened and triggered to recall sad memories of our own “closeted” educations. I later had a long phone conversation with the president of the museum. She reached out to me after the unfortunate incident and seemed sympathetic. She patiently listened and said she wanted to hear everything I had to say, restoring my hope that the museum might evolve to forthrightly embrace the many queer figures of Anthony’s coterie. It’s troubling that our cultural institutions don’t do enough to take the initiative without being prodded to educate their staff to present queer history willingly and to respond without bigotry to questions about it. The “straight-supremacist flinch” is a homophobic kneejerk reaction that needs to be discarded. Where are the scholars and documentarians who will tell the truth and convey it compellingly to a mass audience? Why do some modern academics continue to render lesbians invisible and refuse to use the word lesbian to describe women of earlier eras, not realizing how absurd these ivory-tower practices are? If lesbians and gays are defined as predominantly romantically attracted to their own sex, then they’ve existed in various cultural settings throughout history and Anthony was obviously a lesbian. If I had learned the truth about the many magnificent contributions of queer folks like Anthony, Dickinson and Shaw, to US history – if I had known that LGBTQ history is an integral part of global history – my childhood would have been different. If we collectively continue to erase Anthony’s queerness and only vaguely say things like “she never married a man,” then what we’ll continue to churn out is the same old dishonest straight-supremacist crap. History – what people did and how they’re remembered – is power. And LGBTQ people have had the power of history taken from them for far too long. Celebrate Susan B. Anthony as the queer, multi-dimensional, intersectional equality goddess she was. She worked with other progressives to sow and fertilize the seeds of a national and global gender revolution. She wanted queer and straight women to have the unfettered liberty to develop their own genuine ways of being and to make their own choices.I',\n",

It’s not a vaccine. A vaccine by definition provides immunity to a disease. This does not provide immunity to anything. In a best-case scenario, it merely reduces the chance of getting a severe case of a virus if one catches it. Hence, it is a medical treatment, not a vaccine. I do not want to take a medical treatment for an illness I do not have. 2. The drug companies, politicians, medical establishment, and media have joined forces to universally refer to this as a vaccine when it is not one, with the intention of manipulating people into feeling safer about undergoing a medical treatment. Because they are being deceitful, I do not trust them, and want nothing to do with their medical treatment. 3. The presumed benefits of this medical treatment are minimal and would not last long in any case. The establishment acknowledges this, and is already talking about additional shots and ever-increasing numbers of new “vaccines” that would be required on a regular basis. I refuse to turn myself into a chronic patient who receives injections of new pharmaceutical products on a regular basis simply to reduce my chances of getting a severe case of a virus that these injections do not even prevent. 4. I can reduce my chances of getting a severe case of a virus by strengthening my immune system naturally. In the event I catch a virus, there are vitamins and well-established drugs that have had wonderful results in warding off the illness, without the risks and unknowns of this medical treatment. 5. The establishment insists that this medical treatment is safe. They cannot possibly know this because the long-term effects are entirely unknown, and will not be known for many years. They may speculate that it is safe, but it is disingenuous for them to make such a claim that cannot possibly be known. Because they are being disingenuous, I do not trust them, and I want no part of their treatment. 6. The drug companies have zero liability if anything goes wrong, and cannot be sued. Same for the politicians who are pushing this treatment. I will not inject myself with a new, experimental medical device when the people behind it accept no liability or responsibility if something goes wrong. I will not risk my health and my life when they refuse to risk anything. 7. Israel’s Prime Minister has openly admitted that the Israeli people are the world’s laboratory for this experimental treatment. I am not interested in being a guinea pig or donating my body to science. 8. Israel agreed to share medical data of its citizens with a foreign drug company as a fundamental part of their agreement to receive this treatment. I never consented for my personal medical data to be shared with any such entity, nor was I even asked. I will not contribute to this sleazy enterprise. 9. The executives and board members at Pfizer are on record that they have not taken their own treatment, despite all the fanfare and assurances. They are claiming that they would consider it unfair to “cut the line”. This is a preposterous excuse, and it takes an unbelievable amount of chutzpah to even say such a thing. Such a “line” is a figment of their own imagination; if they hogged a couple of injections for themselves no one would cry foul. In addition, billionaires with private jets and private islands are not known for waiting in line until hundreds of millions of peasants all over the world go first to receive anything these billionaires want for themselves. 10. The establishment media have accepted this preposterous excuse without question or concern. Moreover, they laud Pfizer’s executives for their supposed self-sacrifice in not taking their own experimental treatment until we go first. Since they consider us such fools, I do not trust them, and do not want their new treatment. They can have my place in line. I’ll go to the very back of the line. 11. Three facts that must be put together: Bill Gates is touting these vaccines as essential to the survival of the human race. Bill Gates believes the world has too many people and needs to be “depopulated”. Bill Gates, perhaps the richest man in the world, has also not been injected. No rush. Uh, no. I’ll pass on any medical treatments he wants me to take. 12. The establishment has been entirely one-sided in celebrating this treatment. The politicians and media are urging people to take it as both a moral and civic duty. The benefits of the treatment are being greatly exaggerated, the risks are being ignored, and the unknowns are being brushed aside. Because they are being deceitful and manipulative, I will not gamble my personal wellbeing on their integrity. 13. There is an intense propaganda campaign for people to take this treatment. Politicians and celebrities are taking selfies of themselves getting injected (perhaps in some cases pretending to get injected), the media is hyping this as the coolest, smartest, most happy and fun thing to do. It is the most widespread marketing campaign in history. This is not at all appropriate for any medical treatment, let alone a brand new one, and it makes me recoil. 14. The masses are following in tow, posting pictures of themselves getting injected with a drug, feeding the mass peer pressure to do the same. There is something very alarming and sick about this, and I want no part of it. I never took drugs just because “everyone’s doing it” and it’s cool. I’m certainly not going to start now. 15. Those who raise concerns about this medical treatment are being bullied, slandered, mocked, censored, ostracized, threatened, and fired from their jobs. This includes medical professionals who have science-based concerns about the drug and caregivers who have witnessed people under their charge suffering horrible reactions and death shortly after being injected. When the establishment is purging good people who risk everything simply to raise concerns about a new medical treatment — even if they don’t outright oppose it — I will trust these brave people over the establishment every time. I cannot think of a single similar case in history when truth and morality turned out to be on the side of the establishment. 16. This is the greatest medical experiment in the history of the human race. 17. It is purposely not being portrayed as the greatest medical experiment in the history of the human race, and the fact that it is a medical experiment at all is being severely downplayed. 18. Were they up front with the masses, very few would agree to participate in such an experiment. Manipulating the masses to participate in a medical experiment under false pretenses violates the foundations of medical ethics and democratic law. I will not allow unethical people who engage in such conduct to inject me with anything. 19. The medical establishment is not informing people about any of this. They have become marketing agents for an experimental drug, serving huge companies and politicians who have made deals with them. This is a direct conflict with their mandate to concern themselves exclusively with the wellbeing of the people under their care. Since the medical establishment has become corrupted, and has become nothing more than a corporate and political tool, I do not trust the experimental drug they want so badly to inject me with. 20. We are being pressured in various ways to get injected, which violates medical ethics and the foundations of democratic society. The best way to get me not to do something is to pressure me to do it. 21. The government has sealed their protocol related to the virus and treatments for THIRTY YEARS. This is information that the public has a right to know, and the government has a responsibility to share. What are they covering up? Do they really expect me to believe that everything is kosher about all this, and that they are concerned first and foremost with my health? The last time they did this was with the Yemenite Children Affair. If you’re not familiar with it, look it up. Now they’re pulling the same shtick. They didn’t fool me the first time, and they’re definitely not fooling me now. 22. The government can share our personal medical data with foreign corporations, but they won’t share their own protocol on the matter with us? I’m out. 23. The establishment has recruited doctors, rabbis, the media, and the masses to harangue people who don’t want to get injected with a new drug. We are being called the worst sort of names. We are being told that we believe in crazy conspiracies, that we are against science, that we are selfish, that we are murderers, that we don’t care about the elderly, that it’s our fault that the government continues to impose draconian restrictions on the public. It’s all because we don’t want to get injected with an experimental treatment, no questions asked. We are even being told that we have a religious obligation to do this, and that we are grave sinners if we do not. They say that if we do not agree to get injected, we should be forced to stay inside our homes forever and be ostracized from public life. This is horrific, disgusting, a perversion of common sense, morality, and the Torah. It makes me recoil, and only further cements my distrust of these people and my opposition to taking their experimental drug. How dare they? 24. I know of many people who got injected, but None of them studied the science in depth, carefully weighed the potential benefits against the risks, compared this option to other alternatives, was truly informed, and decided this medical treatment was the best option for them. On the contrary, they got injected because of the hype, the propaganda, the pressure, the fear, blind trust in what “the majority of experts” supposedly believed (assuming THEY all studied everything in depth and were completely objective, which is highly dubious), blind trust in what certain influential rabbis urged them to do (ditto the above), or hysterical fear that the only option was getting injected or getting seriously ill from the virus. When I see mass hysteria and cult-like behavior surrounding a medical treatment, I will be extremely suspicious and avoid it. 25. The drug companies have a long and glorious history of causing mass carnage with wonder drugs they thrust on unsuspecting populations, even after serious problems had already become known. Instead of pressing the pause button and halting the marketing of these drugs until these issues could be properly investigated, the drug companies did everything in their power to suppress the information and keep pushing their products. When companies and people have demonstrated such gross lack of concern for human life, I will not trust them when they hype a new wonder drug. This isn’t our first rodeo. 26. Indeed, the horror stories are already coming in at warp speed, but the politicians are not the least bit concerned, the medical establishment is brushing them aside as unrelated or negligible, the media is ignoring it, the drug companies are steaming ahead at full speed, and those who raise a red flag continue to be bullied, censored, and punished. Clearly my life and my wellbeing are not their primary concern. I will not be their next guinea pig in their laboratory. I will not risk being the next “coincidence”. 27. Although many people have died shortly after getting injected — including perfectly healthy young people — we are not allowed to imply that the injection had anything to do with it. Somehow this is anti-science and will cause more people to die. I believe that denying any possible link, abusing people who speculate that there might be a link, and demonstrating not the slightest curiosity to even explore if there might be a link is what is anti-science and could very well cause more people to die. These same people believe I am obligated to get injected as well. No freaking thanks. 28. I am repulsed by the religious, cult-like worship of a pharmaceutical product, and will not participate in this ritual. 29. My “healthcare” provider keeps badgering me to get injected, yet they have provided me no information on this treatment or any possible alternatives. Everything I know I learned from others outside the establishment. Informed consent has become conformed consent. I decline. 30. I see all the lies, corruption, propaganda, manipulation, censorship, bullying, violation of medical ethics, lack of integrity in the scientific process, suppression of inconvenient adverse reactions, dismissal of legitimate concerns, hysteria, cult-like behavior, ignorance, closed-mindedness, fear, medical and political tyranny, concealment of protocols, lack of true concern for human life, lack of respect for basic human rights and freedoms, perversion of the Torah and common sense, demonization of good people, the greatest medical experiment of all time being conducted by greedy, untrustworthy, godless people, the lack of liability for those who demand I risk everything… I see all this and I have decided they can all have my place in line. I will put my trust in God. I will use the mind He blessed me with and trust my natural instincts. Which leads to the final reason which sums up why I will not get “vaccinated.” 31.

       " 12: {'Hatespeech': 'oudlytransparenttrash: Democrats recently announced a commission to study the feasibility of giving reparations to every black American as a way to soften racial tension, or something. Though one of Biden’s senior advisers declared that black America isn’t going wait for a committee or study. “We don’t want to wait. We’re going to start acting now,” said senior adviser Cedric Richmond. Not only would black Americans receive direct financial handouts for being black, the proposition is to also make it so that “homes are not valued less than homes in different communities just because of the neighborhood it’s in.” This apparently involves some type of government manipulation to ensure that homes in crime-ridden and gang-infested areas are forced to go on the market at the same price as houses in the Hamptons. But in what world would somebody pay the same price? When Richmond was asked how exactly that could be done, of course he couldn’t come up with an answer. Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee, who advanced the reparations bill currently making its way through Congress, said that giving black people free cash is “a way to bring the country together,” despite only 29 percent of Americans supporting it, including only 1 in 3 Democrat voters. Here are nine reasons why slavery reparations today is stupid: 1. There is no one group responsible for slavery The slave trade was for a thousand years already established in Africa, Asia and the Middle East before Europeans showed up. Muslim slave traders took twenty times the amount of African slaves. Slavery was part of every civilization on the planet, it has been part of the economic structure in every single country’s history, every race have either taken slaves or have been enslaved - including whites. The earliest recorded slaves were Europeans enslaved in North Africa. It’s America who has the shortest and smallest history of slavery compared to any other part of the world, yet America is cast as solely responsible. There were 10.7 million African slaves during the Atlantic slave trade, but only 3-4 percent of those, or about 380,000, were taken to North America. Almost all slaves were taken to South America and the Caribbean, not the U.S. Plus, by 1830 there were almost 4000 black slave owners in the U.S, owning 13 thousand slaves. Who exactly today are we holding responsible for slavery? 2. America was not built on slavery America did not get rich from slaves, the North had a thriving industrial economy, they produced 94 percent of the country’s iron, 97 percent of is coal, built majority of the railroads, did 75 percent of the country’s farming, produced 60 percent of its livestock, produced 17 times more cotton and woolen textiles than the South, and all in all they held 75 percent of the nation’s total wealth - all without slaves. Sure, most of the South’s economy was built on slaves picking cotton as the South had little manufacturing capability, but remember the South’s economy crashed to zero after the civil war and it was rebuilt without slaves, so it’s absurd to suggest America was built on slavery. Also, what’s with this “400 years of slavery” thing? If we use 1619 as the beginning and the 1865 13th Amendment as its end, that’s 246 years, not 400. 3. There is no one group that has benefited exclusively The claim for reparations is premised on the false assumption that only white Americans have benefited from slavery. If slave labor created wealth for white Americans, then obviously it has created wealth for black Americans as well. Black buying power is $1.4 trillion, that is so much combined spending power that it would make black America one of the largest economies in the world in terms of Gross Domestic Product. Black Americans earning $75,000 or more per year are growing faster in size and influence than whites in all income groups above $60,000. The black middle-class in America is a prosperous community that is now larger in absolute terms than the black underclass. Also, unless you don’t have a phone, Nike sneakers, clothes, chocolate or anything battery operated, you are benefiting from slavery and it’s about time you start paying up reparations, hypocrite. 4. America today is a multi-ethnic nation and most Americans have no connection to slavery We already know there was only a tiny fraction of white slave owners in America, so expecting 250 million white Americans today to pay for a crime that they or their ancestors played no part in, is beyond dumb. Many whites are recent immigrants. The two great waves of American immigration happened after 1880 and then after 1960. What rationale would require Russian refuseniks, Armenian victims of the Turkish persecution, Jews, Greeks, Polish, Hungarians to pay reparations to black Americans? Are we supposed to track the ancestry of everyone until we find the few who had slaveholder ancestors hundreds of years ago, and then tax them for reparations? To cover the trillions of dollars in cash reparations, it means all Americans would be forced to pay for something they didn’t do, which doesn’t sound “equitable” or like justice to me. 5. Previous precedents used to justify reparations do not apply Reparations were meant as payments to immediate family or direct victims of injury caused by injustice. This bill being pushed through Congress would be the only case of reparations to people who were not immediately affected and whose sole qualification to receive reparations would be their skin color. Reparations has never been about giving free stuff to random people who share the same skin color as those wronged centuries ago and neither should it ever be. It’s an attempt to ripoff the system and they know it. 6. America didn’t start slavery, it ended it Slavery existed for thousands of years before the Atlantic slave trade was born, and in all societies. But in the thousand years of its existence, there never was an anti-slavery movement until the English and Americans created one. If not for these anti-slavery attitudes and military power of the English and Americans, and if not for the deaths of hundreds of thousands of Americans, slave trades around the world would not have been brought to an end. For all America’s faults, our country was the first to end slavery, long before any other part of the world. It’s over now, we are no longer slaves, we aren’t slave masters, we aren’t oppressed and we aren’t oppressors. 7. The argument is based on the unfounded claim that all black Americans suffer from the economic consequences of slavery No evidence-based attempt has been made to prove that living individuals have been adversely affected by a slave system that has long ended. But there is plenty of evidence the hardships that occurred were hardships that individuals could and did overcome. Look at the earliest Asians to immigrate to America. The “coolies” were imported by the power brokers to work on major infrastructure projects and they were treated no better than African slaves, but there is no lingering legacy of the coolie system because their decedents have worked hard to put that era behind them. Asian Americans are now the most educated and highest earning people in the country. If only white people can be successful in America, then why are minorities such as Filipino, Taiwanese and Indian Americans doing far better on average than white Americans? Everyone has history of slavery and injustice, why should black Americans be the only ones refusing to better ourselves? What Asian Americans have proven is that privilege in America is based not on race but on merit. People of any race can succeed in America if they take education seriously, develop a positive work ethic, obey the rules and maintain strong relationships and families. 8. One more attempt to keep black Americans dependent on government The renewed sense of grievance and victimhood which is what the claim for reparations inevitably creates is neither a constructive nor a helpful message for black leaders to be sending to black youth and communities. To focus your entire mindset and narrative on the past instead of the future will only continue to kill any progress that no amount of cash handouts can fix. Spending all your efforts demanding others to pay you for doing nothing and to give you things for doing nothing, instead of wanting to pay for it yourself or earn it yourself is a tragic mindset to live in. What happens after you spend the cash? The country is now bankrupt and nothing has changed. I support programs and efforts dedicated to improving black lives, families and education, but if we’re going to spend money, it has to be used to create more permanent and constructive changes, not shameful, short-term appeasements. 9. Reparations to black Americans have already been paid Since the passage of the Civil Rights Acts and the advent of the Great Society in 1965, trillions of dollars in payments have been made to black Americans in the form of excessive welfare benefits and affirmative action programs in both employment and education, all under the rationale of redressing historic racial grievances. It is said that reparations are necessary to achieve a healing between black and white Americans. If trillion dollar restitutions and a wholesale rewriting of American law in order to accommodate racial preferences for black Americans is not enough to achieve a “healing,” what ever will? The answer is nothing will ever be good enough because if it ever were, then the excuses would have to stop. In return, accountability will take its place, which even just mentioning the word makes reparation-pushers wince. It’s healthy to be aware of past wrongdoings, mourn and condemn past atrocities, but that must apply to all of us, not just those of a certain race we can blame all our problems on. If we’re going to cast blame and justify hatred on white people today for the slavery and atrocities committed throughout American history, then we are no less innocent for the slavery and atrocities committed throughout African history. We can either keep throwing stones from within glass houses or we can let go of the divisive and separatist policies and sentiments and continue building the most free, fair and successful futures for all Americans. We should never ignore or forget our history, we just need to learn from it, never repeat it and stop taking advantage of it to get free stuff today.

Center for Social Cohesion: 40% of British Muslims want Sharia to be enforced under threat of violence NOP Research: 68% of British Muslims support the arrest and prosecution of anyone who insults Islam MacDonald Laurier Institute: 62% of Muslims want Sharia in Canada Pew Research (2010): 82% of Egyptian Muslims favour stoning adulterers 70% of Jordanian Muslims favour stoning adulterers 82% of Pakistanis favour stoning adulterers Pew Research (2013): 81% of South Asian Muslims support amputating limbs for theft 2015 (Jyllands Posten): 77% of Muslims in Denmark believe the Quran’s instructions should be ‘fully applied’ Syarif Hidayatullah State University Study (2017): 80% of Islamic education teachers favour enforcement of Sharia; 89% say non-Muslims “should not be accommodated” in Indonesia. Now as for the second crybaby @meljane7, and another brilliant addition by @feminismandmedia asking “How is Islam misogynistic??”. Yes, real people actually wrote that. But luckily for them, I have in fact read and studied the Quran in depth, for this exact reason. I can now quote the vile book directly too you and it does the work for me! Isn’t that great? In Islam, a man is given the right to beat his wife until she obeys (Sura 4:34, Bukhari 8.73.68). According the Qur’an, “Men are in charge of women, because Allah has made some of them to excel others…and those on whose part you fear rebellion, admonish them, and leave them alone in beds apart, and beat them.” Oh and just in case you were considering defending spousal abuse in the name of tolerance, the Arabic word for beat used in the Qur’an is the same word used for the treatment of slaves and animals. Muhammad himself was a degenerate, licentious and vile man, he had thirteen wives, two forced concubines/sex slaves, and four other women with whom he had regular sexual relationships. Not to mention, by the way, that one of Muhammad’s wives was six years old when he married her, but nine years old when he consummated his marriage with her, so that’s okay, right? (See Aisha) Also of interest, Muhammad married his daughter-in-law Zainab (Bukhari 9.93.516-518). He arranged for his adopted son Zaid to divorce her simply so he could marry her. Faced with the refusal of Zaid to dissolve his marriage, Muhammad had another convenient revelation from Allah, which not only commanded Zaid to give up his wife to Muhammad, but also decreed that there was no evil in a father-in-law taking his daughter-in-law away from his own adopted son (Sura 33:36-38). Sura 2:223 explains that “Your wives are your fields, so go into your fields whichever way you like.” Is this how husbands should think of their wives? Is this an example of the perfect divinely inspired revealed truth dictated from Allah to Muhammad? No, feminists don’t support bigoted & hateful women, they are bigoted and hateful women. Now for the sake of @themixedfeminist let’s quickly compare what we have read so far to the Christian teachings about women, shall we? Y’know, the same Christian teachings you call misogynistic and that @meljane7 blamed for the problems in France and Europe today. Also, bear in mind Islam is hundreds of years more ‘modern’ than Christianity is, so of course Christianity will be even more barbaric and sexist, right? Wrong. Firstly please read this article, it details everything Christianity has done to improve women’s rights throughout history. Secondly, two books of the Old Testament are named for (and are about) women. Women play an even more venerated and prominent role in the New Testament, especially in view of the low status afforded women in the culture in which Jesus lived. Read Matthew 5:32; 1 Corinthians 11:11-12; Galatians 3:28; Ephesians 5:25-33. There are 21 notable women mentioned favourably in the New Testament. While the Bible teaches different roles for women than for men, the New Testament elevates women in many ways. It teaches, “Husbands, love your wives, just as Christ loved the church and gave himself up for her to make her holy, cleansing her by the washing with water through the word, and to present her to himself as a radiant church, without stain or wrinkle or any other blemish, but holy and blameless. In this same way, husbands ought to love their wives as their own selves. “He who loves his wife loves himself.” In stark contrast, let’s quickly go over some more Muslim attitudes to women: Prostitution is common in many Muslim countries, especially countries in Africa. Muslims justify prostitution by marrying the woman for the night, which seems to be ‘okay’ as long as they stay within the limit of four wives at one time. Genital mutilation of women is also a widespread practice in Muslim countries. In some countries 90% of women are so mutilated. The Qur’an and hadiths teach that it is morally acceptable to force women to have sex with their captors (Suras 4:24, 70:29-30; also Bukhari 8.77.600; 9.93.506; also Muslim Hadiths numbers 8:3371 and 8:3433). Islam teaches that the majority of people in hell are women (Bukhari 1.2.28, 1.6.301, and 2.18.161). According to the prophet of Islam, “I looked at Hell and saw that the majority of its inhabitants were women.” Passages from the Quran, Hadith and Sira: Quran (4:34) - “Men are the maintainers of women because Allah has made some of them to excel others and because they spend out of their property; the good women are therefore obedient, guarding the unseen as Allah has guarded; and (as to) those on whose part you fear desertion, admonish them, and leave them alone in the sleeping-places and beat them; then if they obey you, do not seek a way against them; surely Allah is High, Great.“ Quran (38:44) - “And take in your hand a green branch and beat her with it, and do not break your oath…” Allah telling Job to beat his wife (Tafsir). Sahih Bukhari (72:715) - A woman came to Muhammad and begged him to stop her husband from beating her. Her skin was bruised so badly that it is described as being “greener” than the green veil she was wearing. Muhammad did not admonish her husband, but instead ordered her to return to him and submit to his sexual desires. Sahih Bukhari (72:715) - “Aisha said, ‘I have not seen any woman suffering as much as the believing women’”, so Muhammad’s own wife complained of the abuse that the women of her religion suffered relative to other women. Sahih Muslim (4:2127) - Muhammad struck his favorite wife, Aisha, in the chest one evening when she left the house without his permission. Aisha narrates, “He struck me on the chest which caused me pain.” Sahih Muslim (9:3506) - Muhammad’s fathers-in-law (Abu Bakr and Umar) amused him by slapping his wives (Aisha and Hafsa) for annoying him. According to the Hadith, the prophet of Islam laughed upon hearing this. Abu Dawud (2141) - “Iyas bin ‘Abd Allah bin Abi Dhubab reported the Apostle of Allah (may peace be upon him) as saying: Do not beat Allah’s handmaidens, but when ‘Umar came to the Apostle of Allah (may peace be upon him) and said: Women have become emboldened towards their husbands, he (the Prophet) gave permission to beat them.” Muhammad saw that women were becoming emboldened toward their husbands, and decided that beatings in a Muslim marriage are necessary to keep women in their place. Abu Dawud (2142) - “The Prophet (peace be upon him) said: A man will not be asked as to why he beat his wife.” Abu Dawud (2126) - “A man from the Ansar called Basrah said: ‘I married a virgin woman in her veil. When I entered upon her, I found her pregnant. (I mentioned this to the Prophet).’ The Prophet (peace_be_upon_him) said: \\'She will get the dower, for you made her vagina lawful for you. The child will be your slave. When she has begotten (a child), flog her’” Basically, a Muslim thinks he is getting a virgin, then finds out that she is pregnant. Muhammad tells him to treat the woman as a sex slave and then flog her after she delivers the child. Ibn Ishaq/Hisham 969 - Requires that a married woman be \"put in a separate room and beaten lightly\" if she \"acts in an inappropriate manner toward others.“ According to the Hadith, this can be for an offense as petty as merely being alone with a man to whom she is not related. Finally, Kash-shaf (the revealer) of al-Zamkhshari (Vol. 1, p. 525) - [Muhammad said] \"Hang up your scourge where your wife can see it” just so your wife is aware of what awaits her lest she refuses her husband sex or goes outside without permission. This is the belief system you are defending, you, as a feminist, are advocating the subjugation of women for the sake of political correctness. Open. Your. Eyes. This is the real face of Islam.

It’s weird how a lot men view sex not as an intimate act but as a tool of power and humiliation It’s true and you should say more “Women are framed as property, as collateral damage in the war between black men and white men, each trying to assert their masculinity. Men of both races speak of women in terms of ownership. White men talk of protecting “our women” and how “their women” have no virtue. Black men use similar language; they talk about how white men have defiled “our women”, and in return, they are going to lay waste to “their women”. This language perpetuates the universal subordinate status of women; black men acknowledge that white men own their women and white men acknowledge that black men own their women as well. Women are robbed of their personhood and simply become tools to be paternalistically protected from harm and vandalized for revenge.” — Routledge International Handbook of Race, Class, and Gender (2014).Shirley A. Jackson. source Quote from Eldridge Cleaver, Black Panther Party leader “It is for Black men to speak up and tell us why and how their manhood is so threatened that Black women should be the prime targets of their justifiable rage. What correct analysis of this capitalist dragon within which we live can legitimize the rape of Black women by Black men? At least Black feminists and other Black women have begun this much-needed dialogue, however bitter our words. At least we are not mowing down our brothers in the street, or bludgeoning them to death with hammers. [Robert] Staples pleads his cause by saying capitalism has left the Black man with only his penis for fulfillment, and a ‘curious rage.’ Is this rage any more legitimate than the rage of Black women? And why are Black women supposed to absorb that male rage in silence?” - Audre Lorde i think i’m going to be sick. that eldridge cleaver man actually raped women as “revenge” to white men. and he said he did it because white men have been violating Black women, but HE RAPED BLACK WOMEN TOO, AS “PRACTICE”, KNOWING FEW PEOPLE WOULD CARE. he didn’t do it to avenge the Black women hurt at the hands of white men, he did it because he sees women as property and he was angry that white men “soiled” Black men’s property, and as revenge, he would do the same to white men’s property. men don’t see us as our own people, but only as an extension of them. Men who rape their own race / ethnicity believe women are just something that they are entitled to. Those women are “their women” after all. They believe that men of other races / ethnicities need to respect that. When they don’t, they feel like the unspoken patriarchal contract between them has been broken and betrayed and must be met with some type of revenge for “soiling their women”; a resource is now “tainted”.',\n",
