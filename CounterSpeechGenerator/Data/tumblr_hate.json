History is replete with almost every culture and nation having slaves when they were the victors, or the strongest. Slavery is not unique to Africans, nor unique to the United States. For centuries Muslim countries on the Mediterranean Sea dealt in huge slave trades. Many of those slaves were white. Conquered nations routinely were turned into slaves. It is a very ugly and shameful history of most of humanity. Ugly or not it shouldn\u2019t be swept under the carpet and forgotten. That is how history repeats itself. I understand why Confederate statues can be construed as offensive. They represent a sordid and brutal past that no American today should think well of. There should be no honoring of the institution of slavery, ever. The Civil War was not just about slavery. It was about a country being torn apart by a divisive and growing cancer of malcontent. It was about saving the better angels of our nation\u2019s great founding principles. It was about preserving our future and not letting it dissipate into a mere shell of its potential. 600,000 soldiers died in that war. And who knows how many civilians?

The attacks and rioting went on for two days. While the exact figure is not known, it is estimated that at least 180 Jews were killed in Baghdad and Basra, perhaps as many as 600, and hundreds more were wounded. Jewish women were gang raped and mutilated. Jewish shops and homes were looted and then torched. Synagogues were looted and Torah scrolls burned. Afraid to give the dead a proper burial, the corpses were buried in a large mass grave. This pogrom was named the Farhud, which in Arabic means violent dispossession. The Farhud marked an irrevocable loss for Jewish life in Iraq and paved the way for the dissolution of the 2,600-year-old Jewish community 10 years later. Forced out by fear of a second Farhud and denationalizing legislation that made them stateless refugees, the overwhelming majority of Iraq\u2019s Jewish community immigrated to Israel after 1948. Others held on for a few more decades, but today, the historic Jewish community of Iraq, which gave us Ezra the Scribe, the academies of Sura and Pumbedita, and the Babylonian Talmud, is no more. Unfortunately, this important moment in Jewish history is little known. It is crucial that Jews and non-Jews around the world commemorate the Farhud as an event which ended thousands of years of Jewish culture, civilization and learning.

A couple of armed terrorists walk into a building and start shooting Jews. A pigua (terrorist attack). Americans are also beginning to become familiar with it as well, after piguim at synagogues in Pittsburgh and California, and now a Jewish market in Jersey city. Europe, too, has long since accustomed herself to such things. In Israel we also have street attacks on Jews, sometimes with knives and sometimes with cars. In America the street attacks have mostly been with fists or bricks or bats, but unless something changes, the knives will come out soon, if they haven\u2019t already. Hardened as they may be to anti-Jewish violence, Israelis were shocked by Jersey City. Not so much by the attack, which was small by our standards with \u201conly\u201d three civilians and one police officer murdered, but by the response of the local community, captured in a video (here) which appears to show (I have reservations, discussed below) local residents blaming the Jews themselves for the attack, and expressing vicious hatred of them. There are various factors contributing to the wave of violent Jew-hatred that has suddenly burst upon the world. It\u2019s not simple. There are several foci of infection that have festered independently as well as cross-fertilizing themselves, gaining new ideas, strategies, connections \u2013 and adherents. There is the leftist/Arab Israel-focused thread which flourishes at the UN and in Europe, which grew from a seed planted by the KGB in the 1960s; there is the neo-Nazi thread which truly goes back to the original Nazis; there is the paleo-Catholic Christ-killer theme that Pope Paul VI\u2019s nostre aetate never succeeded to stamp out; there is the Quran-based Islamic version; there is the Christian Identity movement in the US; there is the Nation of Islam\u2019s ideology, beginning with Elijah Muhammad and espoused today by Louis Farrakhan; and there are countless small groups with various forms of antisemitic thinking, including the Black Hebrew Israelites with which the Jersey City killers were associated. And those are just off the top of my head. Seventy years or so after the Holocaust, the pressure from all of these antisemitic memes \u2013 especially those connected with the Israel-Arab conflict \u2013 broke through the taboo against public expression of antisemitism. It became possible to say openly that Jews were every bit as bad as Hitler thought they were, and that the best thing would be for them to disappear. At the same time, the example provided by the Palestinians, who showed that if you really hate Jews, you can murder them, made killing Jews a thinkable option for today\u2019s antisemites. Mix in a little social media to serve as a catalyst and medium for coordination, and here we are today. So what can be done, say, in Jersey City? First, I\u2019m not sure that the video is an accurate depiction of the mood of most of the non-Jewish community. There are some accounts (also here) that say that the Hasidic community got along well with the local, mostly black, residents, despite tensions about gentrification of the neighborhood. I don\u2019t entirely trust the video: it appears to be edited heavily, and None of the speakers responsible for the anti-Jewish remarks were visible. But still, I heard what I heard. Let\u2019s assume that at least some local residents share the feelings expressed in the video. Should we try to educate them, to explain to them that their attitudes are wrong \u2013 that the Satmar Hasidim who live in their neighborhood are people just like them, and don\u2019t deserve to be shot? That would be hard to do. They are not just like them, they dress differently, eat differently, speak a different language, educate their children differently, and of course practice a different and perhaps sinister religion. They stay aloof from the locals, which is often interpreted as \u201cthey think they are better than we are\u201d (I am not speculating on whether this is a correct interpretation). The secret to educating antisemites so that they will stop being antisemites remains undiscovered. What exactly do you say to someone to make them stop hating Jews? Teaching them about the Holocaust just gives them ideas. It is also not possible to make the Hasidic Jews more appealing to non-Jews. Should we tell them to dress differently? To eat the same food? To send their children to public schools? To convert to Christianity or Islam? All this was tried before, with very unhappy results. Trying to change Jews in order to reduce antisemitism is a losing proposition; antisemites will always find a reason to hate them. This was true for Spanish Conversos in the 15th and 16th centuries, for Germans of the Mosaic Persuasion in the 19th, and probably will someday be true for the progressive Reform Jews of North America. The problem resides with the antisemites, not the Jews, and it can\u2019t be fixed by \u201cfixing\u201d the Jews. But even if we can\u2019t eliminate antisemitism, there are things we can do to mitigate the current wave of antisemitic acts. One is to understand and act on the principle that although we can\u2019t guarantee that people will like Jews, we can force them to respect us, both as individual Jews in the diaspora and collectively in the State of Israel. In the diaspora, Jews should secure their institutions and arm themselves to the extent that the law permits. Self-defense training should be part of all Jewish education. Nobody is respected for being a victim. The primary function of a state is to guarantee the security of its citizens. Insofar as we must depend on government, particularly when restrictive laws make self-defense difficult, then we have to demand that it does its job. When there is a crime wave targeting a specific sector of the population, police resources in that sector have to be increased. Jews ought to have enough political power in a place like New York City to insist that street violence against their fellow Jews, even if the perpetrators are black and Hispanic De Blasio voters, be suppressed. Unfortunately, this is not the case in Hudson County, New Jersey, where Jersey City is located. Finally, if it turns out that diaspora Jewish communities cannot be defended or that their host governments do not care to do their part in doing so, there is the option of aliyah. This puts the Satmar Hasidim, who bitterly oppose the Jewish state, between a rock and a hard place. But that is their problem, not mine.

It\u2019s not a vaccine. A vaccine by definition provides immunity to a disease. This does not provide immunity to anything. In a best-case scenario, it merely reduces the chance of getting a severe case of a virus if one catches it. Hence, it is a medical treatment, not a vaccine. I do not want to take a medical treatment for an illness I do not have. 2. The drug companies, politicians, medical establishment, and media have joined forces to universally refer to this as a vaccine when it is not one, with the intention of manipulating people into feeling safer about undergoing a medical treatment. Because they are being deceitful, I do not trust them, and want nothing to do with their medical treatment. 3. The presumed benefits of this medical treatment are minimal and would not last long in any case. The establishment acknowledges this, and is already talking about additional shots and ever-increasing numbers of new \u201cvaccines\u201d that would be required on a regular basis. I refuse to turn myself into a chronic patient who receives injections of new pharmaceutical products on a regular basis simply to reduce my chances of getting a severe case of a virus that these injections do not even prevent. 4. I can reduce my chances of getting a severe case of a virus by strengthening my immune system naturally. In the event I catch a virus, there are vitamins and well-established drugs that have had wonderful results in warding off the illness, without the risks and unknowns of this medical treatment. 5. The establishment insists that this medical treatment is safe. They cannot possibly know this because the long-term effects are entirely unknown, and will not be known for many years. They may speculate that it is safe, but it is disingenuous for them to make such a claim that cannot possibly be known. Because they are being disingenuous, I do not trust them, and I want no part of their treatment. 6. The drug companies have zero liability if anything goes wrong, and cannot be sued. Same for the politicians who are pushing this treatment. I will not inject myself with a new, experimental medical device when the people behind it accept no liability or responsibility if something goes wrong. I will not risk my health and my life when they refuse to risk anything. 7. Israel\u2019s Prime Minister has openly admitted that the Israeli people are the world\u2019s laboratory for this experimental treatment. I am not interested in being a guinea pig or donating my body to science. 8. Israel agreed to share medical data of its citizens with a foreign drug company as a fundamental part of their agreement to receive this treatment. I never consented for my personal medical data to be shared with any such entity, nor was I even asked. I will not contribute to this sleazy enterprise. 9. The executives and board members at Pfizer are on record that they have not taken their own treatment, despite all the fanfare and assurances. They are claiming that they would consider it unfair to \u201ccut the line\u201d. This is a preposterous excuse, and it takes an unbelievable amount of chutzpah to even say such a thing. Such a \u201cline\u201d is a figment of their own imagination; if they hogged a couple of injections for themselves no one would cry foul. In addition, billionaires with private jets and private islands are not known for waiting in line until hundreds of millions of peasants all over the world go first to receive anything these billionaires want for themselves. 10. The establishment media have accepted this preposterous excuse without question or concern. Moreover, they laud Pfizer\u2019s executives for their supposed self-sacrifice in not taking their own experimental treatment until we go first. Since they consider us such fools, I do not trust them, and do not want their new treatment. They can have my place in line. I\u2019ll go to the very back of the line. 11. Three facts that must be put together: Bill Gates is touting these vaccines as essential to the survival of the human race. Bill Gates believes the world has too many people and needs to be \u201cdepopulated\u201d. Bill Gates, perhaps the richest man in the world, has also not been injected. No rush. Uh, no. I\u2019ll pass on any medical treatments he wants me to take. 12. The establishment has been entirely one-sided in celebrating this treatment. The politicians and media are urging people to take it as both a moral and civic duty. The benefits of the treatment are being greatly exaggerated, the risks are being ignored, and the unknowns are being brushed aside. Because they are being deceitful and manipulative, I will not gamble my personal wellbeing on their integrity. 13. There is an intense propaganda campaign for people to take this treatment. Politicians and celebrities are taking selfies of themselves getting injected (perhaps in some cases pretending to get injected), the media is hyping this as the coolest, smartest, most happy and fun thing to do. It is the most widespread marketing campaign in history. This is not at all appropriate for any medical treatment, let alone a brand new one, and it makes me recoil. 14. The masses are following in tow, posting pictures of themselves getting injected with a drug, feeding the mass peer pressure to do the same. There is something very alarming and sick about this, and I want no part of it. I never took drugs just because \u201ceveryone\u2019s doing it\u201d and it\u2019s cool. I\u2019m certainly not going to start now. 15. Those who raise concerns about this medical treatment are being bullied, slandered, mocked, censored, ostracized, threatened, and fired from their jobs. This includes medical professionals who have science-based concerns about the drug and caregivers who have witnessed people under their charge suffering horrible reactions and death shortly after being injected. When the establishment is purging good people who risk everything simply to raise concerns about a new medical treatment \u2014 even if they don\u2019t outright oppose it \u2014 I will trust these brave people over the establishment every time. I cannot think of a single similar case in history when truth and morality turned out to be on the side of the establishment. 16. This is the greatest medical experiment in the history of the human race. 17. It is purposely not being portrayed as the greatest medical experiment in the history of the human race, and the fact that it is a medical experiment at all is being severely downplayed. 18. Were they up front with the masses, very few would agree to participate in such an experiment. Manipulating the masses to participate in a medical experiment under false pretenses violates the foundations of medical ethics and democratic law. I will not allow unethical people who engage in such conduct to inject me with anything. 19. The medical establishment is not informing people about any of this. They have become marketing agents for an experimental drug, serving huge companies and politicians who have made deals with them. This is a direct conflict with their mandate to concern themselves exclusively with the wellbeing of the people under their care. Since the medical establishment has become corrupted, and has become nothing more than a corporate and political tool, I do not trust the experimental drug they want so badly to inject me with. 20. We are being pressured in various ways to get injected, which violates medical ethics and the foundations of democratic society. The best way to get me not to do something is to pressure me to do it. 21. The government has sealed their protocol related to the virus and treatments for THIRTY YEARS. This is information that the public has a right to know, and the government has a responsibility to share. What are they covering up? Do they really expect me to believe that everything is kosher about all this, and that they are concerned first and foremost with my health? The last time they did this was with the Yemenite Children Affair. If you\u2019re not familiar with it, look it up. Now they\u2019re pulling the same shtick. They didn\u2019t fool me the first time, and they\u2019re definitely not fooling me now. 22. The government can share our personal medical data with foreign corporations, but they won\u2019t share their own protocol on the matter with us? I\u2019m out. 23. The establishment has recruited doctors, rabbis, the media, and the masses to harangue people who don\u2019t want to get injected with a new drug. We are being called the worst sort of names. We are being told that we believe in crazy conspiracies, that we are against science, that we are selfish, that we are murderers, that we don\u2019t care about the elderly, that it\u2019s our fault that the government continues to impose draconian restrictions on the public. It\u2019s all because we don\u2019t want to get injected with an experimental treatment, no questions asked. We are even being told that we have a religious obligation to do this, and that we are grave sinners if we do not. They say that if we do not agree to get injected, we should be forced to stay inside our homes forever and be ostracized from public life. This is horrific, disgusting, a perversion of common sense, morality, and the Torah. It makes me recoil, and only further cements my distrust of these people and my opposition to taking their experimental drug. How dare they? 24. I know of many people who got injected, but None of them studied the science in depth, carefully weighed the potential benefits against the risks, compared this option to other alternatives, was truly informed, and decided this medical treatment was the best option for them. On the contrary, they got injected because of the hype, the propaganda, the pressure, the fear, blind trust in what \u201cthe majority of experts\u201d supposedly believed (assuming THEY all studied everything in depth and were completely objective, which is highly dubious), blind trust in what certain influential rabbis urged them to do (ditto the above), or hysterical fear that the only option was getting injected or getting seriously ill from the virus. When I see mass hysteria and cult-like behavior surrounding a medical treatment, I will be extremely suspicious and avoid it. 25. The drug companies have a long and glorious history of causing mass carnage with wonder drugs they thrust on unsuspecting populations, even after serious problems had already become known. Instead of pressing the pause button and halting the marketing of these drugs until these issues could be properly investigated, the drug companies did everything in their power to suppress the information and keep pushing their products. When companies and people have demonstrated such gross lack of concern for human life, I will not trust them when they hype a new wonder drug. This isn\u2019t our first rodeo. 26. Indeed, the horror stories are already coming in at warp speed, but the politicians are not the least bit concerned, the medical establishment is brushing them aside as unrelated or negligible, the media is ignoring it, the drug companies are steaming ahead at full speed, and those who raise a red flag continue to be bullied, censored, and punished. Clearly my life and my wellbeing are not their primary concern. I will not be their next guinea pig in their laboratory. I will not risk being the next \u201ccoincidence\u201d. 27. Although many people have died shortly after getting injected \u2014 including perfectly healthy young people \u2014 we are not allowed to imply that the injection had anything to do with it. Somehow this is anti-science and will cause more people to die. I believe that denying any possible link, abusing people who speculate that there might be a link, and demonstrating not the slightest curiosity to even explore if there might be a link is what is anti-science and could very well cause more people to die. These same people believe I am obligated to get injected as well. No freaking thanks. 28. I am repulsed by the religious, cult-like worship of a pharmaceutical product, and will not participate in this ritual. 29. My \u201chealthcare\u201d provider keeps badgering me to get injected, yet they have provided me no information on this treatment or any possible alternatives. Everything I know I learned from others outside the establishment. Informed consent has become conformed consent. I decline. 30. I see all the lies, corruption, propaganda, manipulation, censorship, bullying, violation of medical ethics, lack of integrity in the scientific process, suppression of inconvenient adverse reactions, dismissal of legitimate concerns, hysteria, cult-like behavior, ignorance, closed-mindedness, fear, medical and political tyranny, concealment of protocols, lack of true concern for human life, lack of respect for basic human rights and freedoms, perversion of the Torah and common sense, demonization of good people, the greatest medical experiment of all time being conducted by greedy, untrustworthy, godless people, the lack of liability for those who demand I risk everything\u2026 I see all this and I have decided they can all have my place in line. I will put my trust in God. I will use the mind He blessed me with and trust my natural instincts. Which leads to the final reason which sums up why I will not get \u201cvaccinated.\u201d 31.

It\u2019s a sacrifice I hope we\u2019re all willing to make Actual sex positivity for women would revolve around: 1. Women speaking up when they\u2019re not experiencing pleasure. 2. Stopping sex when it\u2019s not feeling good. 3. Women refusing to fake pleasure for any reason. 4.The eradication of our sexuality as a performance or service. 5. Women\u2019s sexuality becoming an authentic expression that centered on our desires and actual, physical pleasure not just the psycho-emotional pleasure that sometimes comes with being a desired object. 6. Your sex partner taking on some of burden of pregnancy prevention and not leaving it all up to you. 7. Abortion on demand. 8. Free reproductive care everywhere. 9. Free birth control. The development of birth control for women that is pain free and doesn\u2019t have any negative side effects 10. Closing the orgasm gap. Restructuring from scratch ALL sexual scripts and habits until women are as likely to cum from sex as men. The kiss-blow job-penetration-script for hetero women being discarded. 11. Continuing to eradicate any shame or danger around sex for women. That can only be done with eradicating violence against women and misogyny in society. How can we expect women to embrace their sexual desires when their desires can still endanger them? You\u2019re attracted to someone and you want to go home with him but he might kill you. You\u2019re horny and want to have a good time but the fact that you wanted sex might be used against you later to justify mistreatment, devaluing, sexual assault or stop you from getting a job.

The third trimester of pregnancy is from week 27 \u2013 40, and it is therefore impossible to suffer a miscarriage due to the fact they are considered as occurring prior to week 20 of a pregnancy.

We\u2019re going to start acting now,\u201d said senior adviser Cedric Richmond. Not only would black Americans receive direct financial handouts for being black, the proposition is to also make it so that \u201chomes are not valued less than homes in different communities just because of the neighborhood it\u2019s in.\u201d This apparently involves some type of government manipulation to ensure that homes in crime-ridden and gang-infested areas are forced to go on the market at the same price as houses in the Hamptons. But in what world would somebody pay the same price? When Richmond was asked how exactly that could be done, of course he couldn\u2019t come up with an answer. Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee, who advanced the reparations bill currently making its way through Congress, said that giving black people free cash is \u201ca way to bring the country together,\u201d despite only 29 percent of Americans supporting it, including only 1 in 3 Democrat voters. Here are nine reasons why slavery reparations today is stupid: 1. There is no one group responsible for slavery The slave trade was for a thousand years already established in Africa, Asia and the Middle East before Europeans showed up. Muslim slave traders took twenty times the amount of African slaves. Slavery was part of every civilization on the planet, it has been part of the economic structure in every single country\u2019s history, every race have either taken slaves or have been enslaved - including whites. The earliest recorded slaves were Europeans enslaved in North Africa. It\u2019s America who has the shortest and smallest history of slavery compared to any other part of the world, yet America is cast as solely responsible. There were 10.7 million African slaves during the Atlantic slave trade, but only 3-4 percent of those, or about 380,000, were taken to North America. Almost all slaves were taken to South America and the Caribbean, not the U.S. Plus, by 1830 there were almost 4000 black slave owners in the U.S, owning 13 thousand slaves. Who exactly today are we holding responsible for slavery? 2. America was not built on slavery America did not get rich from slaves, the North had a thriving industrial economy, they produced 94 percent of the country\u2019s iron, 97 percent of is coal, built majority of the railroads, did 75 percent of the country\u2019s farming, produced 60 percent of its livestock, produced 17 times more cotton and woolen textiles than the South, and all in all they held 75 percent of the nation\u2019s total wealth - all without slaves. Sure, most of the South\u2019s economy was built on slaves picking cotton as the South had little manufacturing capability, but remember the South\u2019s economy crashed to zero after the civil war and it was rebuilt without slaves, so it\u2019s absurd to suggest America was built on slavery. Also, what\u2019s with this \u201c400 years of slavery\u201d thing? If we use 1619 as the beginning and the 1865 13th Amendment as its end, that\u2019s 246 years, not 400. 3. There is no one group that has benefited exclusively The claim for reparations is premised on the false assumption that only white Americans have benefited from slavery. If slave labor created wealth for white Americans, then obviously it has created wealth for black Americans as well. Black buying power is $1.4 trillion, that is so much combined spending power that it would make black America one of the largest economies in the world in terms of Gross Domestic Product. Black Americans earning $75,000 or more per year are growing faster in size and influence than whites in all income groups above $60,000. The black middle-class in America is a prosperous community that is now larger in absolute terms than the black underclass. Also, unless you don\u2019t have a phone, Nike sneakers, clothes, chocolate or anything battery operated, you are benefiting from slavery and it\u2019s about time you start paying up reparations, hypocrite. 4. America today is a multi-ethnic nation and most Americans have no connection to slavery We already know there was only a tiny fraction of white slave owners in America, so expecting 250 million white Americans today to pay for a crime that they or their ancestors played no part in, is beyond dumb. Many whites are recent immigrants. The two great waves of American immigration happened after 1880 and then after 1960. What rationale would require Russian refuseniks, Armenian victims of the Turkish persecution, Jews, Greeks, Polish, Hungarians to pay reparations to black Americans? Are we supposed to track the ancestry of everyone until we find the few who had slaveholder ancestors hundreds of years ago, and then tax them for reparations? To cover the trillions of dollars in cash reparations, it means all Americans would be forced to pay for something they didn\u2019t do, which doesn\u2019t sound \u201cequitable\u201d or like justice to me. 5. Previous precedents used to justify reparations do not apply Reparations were meant as payments to immediate family or direct victims of injury caused by injustice. This bill being pushed through Congress would be the only case of reparations to people who were not immediately affected and whose sole qualification to receive reparations would be their skin color. Reparations has never been about giving free stuff to random people who share the same skin color as those wronged centuries ago and neither should it ever be. It\u2019s an attempt to ripoff the system and they know it. 6. America didn\u2019t start slavery, it ended it Slavery existed for thousands of years before the Atlantic slave trade was born, and in all societies. But in the thousand years of its existence, there never was an anti-slavery movement until the English and Americans created one. If not for these anti-slavery attitudes and military power of the English and Americans, and if not for the deaths of hundreds of thousands of Americans, slave trades around the world would not have been brought to an end. For all America\u2019s faults, our country was the first to end slavery, long before any other part of the world. It\u2019s over now, we are no longer slaves, we aren\u2019t slave masters, we aren\u2019t oppressed and we aren\u2019t oppressors. 7. The argument is based on the unfounded claim that all black Americans suffer from the economic consequences of slavery No evidence-based attempt has been made to prove that living individuals have been adversely affected by a slave system that has long ended. But there is plenty of evidence the hardships that occurred were hardships that individuals could and did overcome. Look at the earliest Asians to immigrate to America. The \u201ccoolies\u201d were imported by the power brokers to work on major infrastructure projects and they were treated no better than African slaves, but there is no lingering legacy of the coolie system because their decedents have worked hard to put that era behind them. Asian Americans are now the most educated and highest earning people in the country. If only white people can be successful in America, then why are minorities such as Filipino, Taiwanese and Indian Americans doing far better on average than white Americans? Everyone has history of slavery and injustice, why should black Americans be the only ones refusing to better ourselves? What Asian Americans have proven is that privilege in America is based not on race but on merit. People of any race can succeed in America if they take education seriously, develop a positive work ethic, obey the rules and maintain strong relationships and families. 8. One more attempt to keep black Americans dependent on government The renewed sense of grievance and victimhood which is what the claim for reparations inevitably creates is neither a constructive nor a helpful message for black leaders to be sending to black youth and communities. To focus your entire mindset and narrative on the past instead of the future will only continue to kill any progress that no amount of cash handouts can fix. Spending all your efforts demanding others to pay you for doing nothing and to give you things for doing nothing, instead of wanting to pay for it yourself or earn it yourself is a tragic mindset to live in. What happens after you spend the cash? The country is now bankrupt and nothing has changed. I support programs and efforts dedicated to improving black lives, families and education, but if we\u2019re going to spend money, it has to be used to create more permanent and constructive changes, not shameful, short-term appeasements. 9. Reparations to black Americans have already been paid Since the passage of the Civil Rights Acts and the advent of the Great Society in 1965, trillions of dollars in payments have been made to black Americans in the form of excessive welfare benefits and affirmative action programs in both employment and education, all under the rationale of redressing historic racial grievances. It is said that reparations are necessary to achieve a healing between black and white Americans. If trillion dollar restitutions and a wholesale rewriting of American law in order to accommodate racial preferences for black Americans is not enough to achieve a \u201chealing,\u201d what ever will? The answer is nothing will ever be good enough because if it ever were, then the excuses would have to stop. In return, accountability will take its place, which even just mentioning the word makes reparation-pushers wince. It\u2019s healthy to be aware of past wrongdoings, mourn and condemn past atrocities, but that must apply to all of us, not just those of a certain race we can blame all our problems on. If we\u2019re going to cast blame and justify hatred on white people today for the slavery and atrocities committed throughout American history, then we are no less innocent for the slavery and atrocities committed throughout African history. We can either keep throwing stones from within glass houses or we can let go of the divisive and separatist policies and sentiments and continue building the most free, fair and successful futures for all Americans. We should never ignore or forget our history, we just need to learn from it, never repeat it and stop taking advantage of it to get free stuff today.

In every culture, there was an initiation by the elders of the teenager, which was an initiation into manhood, but also into the belief system and the moral system of the tribe. That\u2019s fundamental to being part of the human family. We have always had those rituals and those ceremonies. And part of that is the lesson of overcoming self and exploring transcendence. So, modernity only believes in nafs (desires). We believe in ruh (soul), and the nafs being something that is a kind of trap, an illusion, unreal. And all of the religions really agree on that. This is not specifically Islamic. So the big fight, the futuwwa (virtue) for young people has to be overwhelmingly against the lower self. Unless that is subdued and one becomes a beautiful, balanced, restrained, courteous person, full of compassion rather than anxiety, one is never going to overcome any of these issues. One becomes just another turbulent, shouting voice in the crowd. We need to reinvent, rediscover those traditions of futuwwa. And I am probably not making many friends because I am very critical of Sufism in the West, and the fact that the traditional policy of the ummah (Muslim nation) when it expanded into a new territory was, first of all, before the muftis or the qadis (judges) or any of that got going, was to create the Sufi lodges and the shrines and that infrastructure which was the network of Islamisation. We haven\u2019t really done that in the Western world. And as a result there is a whole dimension of the religion and the deepening of peoples\u2019 faith that is simply absent and there is no access to it. Where do you go if you want to go to a Muslim retreat centre, for instance, for the weekend? You can do it with the Buddhists or the Christian monasteries. Where do you do it in Australia for instance? Are there established places the way there used to be across the Muslim world? Plenty of Turks in Australia. Before Ataturk there were 400 Sufi lodges just in Istanbul. It was just part of Muslim life. For the training of akhlaq, adab, futuwwa (virtue, morality, and etiquette), sacrifice, beauty.

First i thought am i gay ? But i thought gay men don\u2019t wanna have sex with women. It took me a long time to come to terms that I\u2019m a black bisexual male. Now i understand the stigma when people hear you are a bisexual male,they think you are having unsafe sex with every guy you see and can\u2019t say no to anyone. That\u2019s so far from the truth yes i like doing sexual things with guys but it doesn\u2019t mean I\u2019m unsafe or i have a STD. It also doesn\u2019t mean i can\u2019t be faithful when i am dating a woman. I see many bi women especially in the black community who get a pass even if they did something with a girl just to try it people will still respect them and they have no problem dating. When it comes to bi black men ,the minute women meets a guy then he tells her he has sexual feeling or he has experimented with his sexuality automatically he\u2019s gay and less of a man and they say men can\u2019t be bisexual , they won\u2019t date us because they afraid we be thinking of a man when they have sex with us or we will end up being gay. I truly don\u2019t get why women get a pass on this but us bi men are forced to be looked at as men that women never wanna date. It\u2019s unfair but we live in a unfair world. I have even had times when i would meet another bisexual woman and i tell her I\u2019m bi but she judges me calls me nasty and says am i sure i don\u2019t have any STD\u2019s ? This type of judgement forces many bisexual black men to hide and not open up to women . A lot of us don\u2019t want to hide many of us want to be open wth the woman we are dating and still be looked at as a strong man. We also don\u2019t want our business not to be shared with your family,girlfriends and most of all social media. People always say just be honest but look at the back lash we might get from it. My friends and family have no need to know my sexual preference. The only person i want to share that with is the woman I\u2019m dating. I can only speak for myself when I\u2019m looking for a woman to date i tend to look for women who are open to bisexual men,but as you already may know it\u2019s so hard. Many many women especially black and Latino women are against us. It\u2019s one of the reasons I\u2019m single now.

The year is roughly 2012-2015. You are a high schooler or young college student and Tumblr is at its popularity peak. This is also just after federal gay marriage in America was passed, and it ended up revealing to public eye and public popularity that, wait, there\u2019s also a lot of other fuck shit going on, including systemic misogyny and sexism in a patriarchal society! Oh no! Now, the easiest way to show you support women and feminism with your whole chest during this period was that we all discovered the concept of radical unlearning, so we all supported women and each other as feminists by going to an EXTREMELY anti-man as a concept at all, mostly without any real ideology behind it. Talking about how men all suck wasn\u2019t actually about men at all, it was just a way to elude to the fact that women deserve better than what they\u2019re getting, right? The subtext and context was important. But see, the problem is, when you\u2019re participating in radical unlearning, it is REALLY easy to accidentally trip and fall into focusing way too much on the radical part of that unlearning. So now the statement \u201cFuck all men, they\u2019re trash\u201d became \u201cI hate all men because they\u2019re all evil and abusing women systemically\u201d. The ideology shifted away from the subtextual focus of \u201cWe\u2019re learning how to support women\u201d and went, for a group of us, into \u201cWe are going to blame men unilaterally for all of womenhood\u2019s systemic struggles.\u201d This is of course absolute bullshit and unfortunately now the phrase \u201cnot all men\u201d is super ideologically poisoned because no matter how true it is, it was used too much by misogynists so now actual feminists can\u2019t address the issue of \u201cHey uh. This may be not great as an ideological concept\u201d without everyone going \u201cSo you\u2019re definitely basically a rapist and hate all women\u201d. And that\u2019s where the shift happened. Because the focus was kept so much on the radicalization of \u201call men are fundamentally bad\u201d, that then needed to define what a man was. That way you knew who to avoid because of their ability to harm you as a woman. And so that\u2019s what led to the radical bioessentialism of \u201cman = penis\u201d and the TERFs got a whole new generation of fresh young faces during the spread of fourth wave feminism. Whoops. If I may \u2013 there was also a rhetorical dodge spread around this time to avoid dealing with intersectionality in any meaningful way (because if we fully apply intersectionality, we find that some women have power over marginalised men and that doesn\u2019t fit with men being the source of all problems). When issues of e.g. white women having privilege over Black men in many situations were raised, white people like myself were taught to go \u201cwell, all other things being equal, Black men have privilege over Black women :)\u201d. You will notice that this isn\u2019t actually intersectional and doesn\u2019t answer the question of Black men\u2019s position relative to white women at all, but it\u2019s a good way of looking like you\u2019re using intersectionality correctly when you aren\u2019t. Often we\u2019d take the dodge further and basically go \u201cif you want to learn about racial oppression, you only have to listen to Black women, because they\u2019re more marginalised than Black men\u201d, as if Black men and women experience the exact same things but Black women experience them Worse, as if \u201cman\u201d isn\u2019t a gender that can have its own interactions with marginalisation that play important parts in how those marginalisations affect everyone.

Now as for the second crybaby @meljane7, and another brilliant addition by @feminismandmedia asking \u201cHow is Islam misogynistic??\u201d. Yes, real people actually wrote that. But luckily for them, I have in fact read and studied the Quran in depth, for this exact reason. I can now quote the vile book directly too you and it does the work for me! Isn\u2019t that great? In Islam, a man is given the right to beat his wife until she obeys (Sura 4:34, Bukhari 8.73.68). According the Qur\u2019an, \u201cMen are in charge of women, because Allah has made some of them to excel others\u2026and those on whose part you fear rebellion, admonish them, and leave them alone in beds apart, and beat them.\u201d Oh and just in case you were considering defending spousal abuse in the name of tolerance, the Arabic word for beat used in the Qur\u2019an is the same word used for the treatment of slaves and animals. Muhammad himself was a degenerate, licentious and vile man, he had thirteen wives, two forced concubines/sex slaves, and four other women with whom he had regular sexual relationships. Not to mention, by the way, that one of Muhammad\u2019s wives was six years old when he married her, but nine years old when he consummated his marriage with her, so that\u2019s okay, right? (See Aisha) Also of interest, Muhammad married his daughter-in-law Zainab (Bukhari 9.93.516-518). He arranged for his adopted son Zaid to divorce her simply so he could marry her. Faced with the refusal of Zaid to dissolve his marriage, Muhammad had another convenient revelation from Allah, which not only commanded Zaid to give up his wife to Muhammad, but also decreed that there was no evil in a father-in-law taking his daughter-in-law away from his own adopted son (Sura 33:36-38). Sura 2:223 explains that \u201cYour wives are your fields, so go into your fields whichever way you like.\u201d Is this how husbands should think of their wives? Is this an example of the perfect divinely inspired revealed truth dictated from Allah to Muhammad? No, feminists don\u2019t support bigoted & hateful women, they are bigoted and hateful women. Now for the sake of @themixedfeminist let\u2019s quickly compare what we have read so far to the Christian teachings about women, shall we? Y\u2019know, the same Christian teachings you call misogynistic and that @meljane7 blamed for the problems in France and Europe today. Also, bear in mind Islam is hundreds of years more \u2018modern\u2019 than Christianity is, so of course Christianity will be even more barbaric and sexist, right? Wrong. Firstly please read this article, it details everything Christianity has done to improve women\u2019s rights throughout history. Secondly, two books of the Old Testament are named for (and are about) women. Women play an even more venerated and prominent role in the New Testament, especially in view of the low status afforded women in the culture in which Jesus lived. Read Matthew 5:32; 1 Corinthians 11:11-12; Galatians 3:28; Ephesians 5:25-33. There are 21 notable women mentioned favourably in the New Testament. While the Bible teaches different roles for women than for men, the New Testament elevates women in many ways. It teaches, \u201cHusbands, love your wives, just as Christ loved the church and gave himself up for her to make her holy, cleansing her by the washing with water through the word, and to present her to himself as a radiant church, without stain or wrinkle or any other blemish, but holy and blameless. In this same way, husbands ought to love their wives as their own selves. \u201cHe who loves his wife loves himself.\u201d In stark contrast, let\u2019s quickly go over some more Muslim attitudes to women: Prostitution is common in many Muslim countries, especially countries in Africa. Muslims justify prostitution by marrying the woman for the night, which seems to be \u2018okay\u2019 as long as they stay within the limit of four wives at one time. Genital mutilation of women is also a widespread practice in Muslim countries. In some countries 90% of women are so mutilated. The Qur\u2019an and hadiths teach that it is morally acceptable to force women to have sex with their captors (Suras 4:24, 70:29-30; also Bukhari 8.77.600; 9.93.506; also Muslim Hadiths numbers 8:3371 and 8:3433). Islam teaches that the majority of people in hell are women (Bukhari 1.2.28, 1.6.301, and 2.18.161). According to the prophet of Islam, \u201cI looked at Hell and saw that the majority of its inhabitants were women.\u201d Passages from the Quran, Hadith and Sira: Quran (4:34) - \u201cMen are the maintainers of women because Allah has made some of them to excel others and because they spend out of their property; the good women are therefore obedient, guarding the unseen as Allah has guarded; and (as to) those on whose part you fear desertion, admonish them, and leave them alone in the sleeping-places and beat them; then if they obey you, do not seek a way against them; surely Allah is High, Great.\u201c Quran (38:44) - \u201cAnd take in your hand a green branch and beat her with it, and do not break your oath\u2026\u201d Allah telling Job to beat his wife (Tafsir). Sahih Bukhari (72:715) - A woman came to Muhammad and begged him to stop her husband from beating her. Her skin was bruised so badly that it is described as being \u201cgreener\u201d than the green veil she was wearing. Muhammad did not admonish her husband, but instead ordered her to return to him and submit to his sexual desires. Sahih Bukhari (72:715) - \u201cAisha said, \u2018I have not seen any woman suffering as much as the believing women\u2019\u201d, so Muhammad\u2019s own wife complained of the abuse that the women of her religion suffered relative to other women. Sahih Muslim (4:2127) - Muhammad struck his favorite wife, Aisha, in the chest one evening when she left the house without his permission. Aisha narrates, \u201cHe struck me on the chest which caused me pain.\u201d Sahih Muslim (9:3506) - Muhammad\u2019s fathers-in-law (Abu Bakr and Umar) amused him by slapping his wives (Aisha and Hafsa) for annoying him. According to the Hadith, the prophet of Islam laughed upon hearing this. Abu Dawud (2141) - \u201cIyas bin \u2018Abd Allah bin Abi Dhubab reported the Apostle of Allah (may peace be upon him) as saying: Do not beat Allah\u2019s handmaidens, but when \u2018Umar came to the Apostle of Allah (may peace be upon him) and said: Women have become emboldened towards their husbands, he (the Prophet) gave permission to beat them.\u201d Muhammad saw that women were becoming emboldened toward their husbands, and decided that beatings in a Muslim marriage are necessary to keep women in their place. Abu Dawud (2142) - \u201cThe Prophet (peace be upon him) said: A man will not be asked as to why he beat his wife.\u201d Abu Dawud (2126) - \u201cA man from the Ansar called Basrah said: \u2018I married a virgin woman in her veil. When I entered upon her, I found her pregnant. (I mentioned this to the Prophet).\u2019 The Prophet (peace_be_upon_him) said: 'She will get the dower, for you made her vagina lawful for you. The child will be your slave. When she has begotten (a child), flog her\u2019\u201d Basically, a Muslim thinks he is getting a virgin, then finds out that she is pregnant. Muhammad tells him to treat the woman as a sex slave and then flog her after she delivers the child. Ibn Ishaq/Hisham 969 - Requires that a married woman be \"put in a separate room and beaten lightly\" if she \"acts in an inappropriate manner toward others.\u201c According to the Hadith, this can be for an offense as petty as merely being alone with a man to whom she is not related. Finally, Kash-shaf (the revealer) of al-Zamkhshari (Vol. 1, p. 525) - [Muhammad said] \"Hang up your scourge where your wife can see it\u201d just so your wife is aware of what awaits her lest she refuses her husband sex or goes outside without permission.

Things people, of ALL races, choose to do. Different countries and cultures have different standards. Race, besides also being a social construct, is judged on skin color. Skin color is immutable. Certain conditions can cause change over lifetime, but in the vast majority of people, that is not changable (tanning aside) We choose to wear certain clothes and make up. We don\u2019t choose our skin color. Even if you go with \u201cwomen were domestic slaves, like black people\u201d, you forget two very important points: Black women were enslaved, too! White women had slaves, too! Black female slaves were stripped of their femininity, their heads often shaven, because they didn\u2019t conform to the white beauty standards, and weren\u2019t allowed to, either. If you really think \u201cmen in dresses\u201d is anywhere close to blackface, you are just showing your white feminism. And, frankly, racism. I will not entertain this asinine, racist \u201cargument\u201d anymore. as a black woman, i don\u2019t think males being feminine is on par with blackface. what i consider comparable to blackface is them taking estrogen & declaring themselves women. there\u2019s no difference. women are female, black people are people with dark skin and african ancestry. a male calling himself a woman is just as offensive as a white person calling themselves black. a male saying he\u2019s a woman bc he has feminine interests is like a white person saying they\u2019re black because they like rap and fried chicken\u2014 utterly offensive & distasteful. id even argue that since sex is immutable and clearly defined, whereas skin tone (though not ancestry/ethnic background) can vary during one\u2019s life, it\u2019s even more offensive for a male to call himself a woman than a white person to call themselves black. no, males in dresses is not blackface , but males wearing dresses and declaring themselves women is absolutely just as bad. But I must say, some drag performances do feel very misogynistic Some drag performances deliberately mock women and stereotypes of women, because we are the butt of the joke. Men dress in exaggerated caricatures of femininity to mock the same demographic group (women) oppressed by femininity. It\u2019s oppressors treating the group they oppress like a costume in order to mock that group. I don\u2019t believe it\u2019s just as bad as blackface but it\u2019s close Wow. Anything to fit your narrative, huh? Drag shows celebrate femininity. They\u2019re also fun, but I\u2019m sure you never heard of fun before. Your lives sound utterly miserable, what with all the hate. Also. If makeup and clothes don\u2019t make a woman, then how can it possibly be misogynistic? People can wear what they want, no? I\u2019m always sorry for any black woman who falls for this white feminism, but it\u2019s your choice. I know I can\u2019t change your mind.

I\u2019ve missed you! You promised me sources! And you haven\u2019t answered my question: To you, and @terfclairenovak , I\u2019d like to say: Long ago, right here on planet Earth, cis men (those with a peen that also see themselves as men) decided, they are the ruling class. They looked at people and categorized them based on superficial traits, such as having a cooch or a peen, and decided those without peen are weak and should serve them. They should only be good for reproduction. They even cut off bits of their bobs, so they wouldn\u2019t and couldn\u2019t enjoy something that should be enjoyable. Only work, no play, no humans rights. For centuries those without a peen, and other groups deemed lesser because of their superficial traits not favored by cis men (for example intersex/trans/nonbinary folk), have fought against being only seen and valued for their bodies, instead of their brains. Nowadays, science has shown that gender and body don\u2019t always fit together. That those are indeed two different things. The brain develops independently from the body, at different times, and sometimes it develops differently, there is an incongruence. But now, people like you want to categorize people based solely on their bits again. Make laws surrounding those bits and their havers. Check those bits if the havers doesn\u2019t fit your definition of what a bitshaver should look like. Even small children. You also want to only allow certain people into certain spaces after they had (parts of) their bits cut off. What does that make people like you? Are YOU really the victims here? Or are you playing another role? to answer your question: key word here is can. not that they do, but that they have the ability to bc their reproductive development is conducive to pregnancy/egg production. you\u2019re right, males oppress women. unfortunately, oppression isn\u2019t something you can identify in/out of. a male mutilating his genitalia to pass as a woman is not oppressed, the fact that misogyny is something he\u2019s opted into is proof it\u2019s not actual oppression. also, sex is real. it\u2019s a material trait with consequences. there are certain things that should be segregated by sex, like sports or abuse shelters or jail, where there are possibly vulnerable populations or the body is being used. we want sex segregated spaces for safety and efficacy and comfort. it\u2019s not \u201ccategorizing\u201d people, the categories already exist. also, stop saying \u201cbits,\u201d it\u2019s sex. we care about sex, the biological trait. your reproductive role. You literally just repeated everything without making an actual point or clarification, but with loads of hateful language. Obesession with genitals again. It\u2019s only ever genitals and reproduction with you. Isn\u2019t that exhausting? Can\u2019t you see people for other things? Art? Music? Anything but SEX?? Hey. Hey mona. Why should SIX YEAR OLD CHILDREN need segregated bathrooms? Also, you literally just said the thing: The thing others are right now trying to tell me you never say. Congrats! the clarification is that being of the sex that can produce eggs does not mean you will; ie a woman who\u2019s had a hysterectomy is female because the uterus is a female sex organ. you brought up genitalia first. yes, i see people as people, female people are people and male people are people, sex and personhood are not mutually exclusive. i\u2019m not going to pretend sex isn\u2019t relevant when we live in a sexist society similarly to how im not going to pretend race isn\u2019t relevant when we live in a racist society. as a black woman, my sex and race are the reason i\u2019m oppressed; pretending these traits don\u2019t exist only allows oppression to continue. six year olds should have segregated bathrooms because adults have segregated bathrooms, and children aren\u2019t as innocent as you\u2019d think. i know countless friends who were assaulted by male classmates when they were very young. also, humans are not boats. a boat and a cart can both be made out of wood, but once you\u2019ve developed as female or male you no longer have the structures that for the opposite sex\u2019s reproductive organs/system. female and male are distinct sexes in humans, you can\u2019t just \u201creorganize\u201d our body parts so we\u2019re interchangeable the clarification is that being of the sex that can produce eggs does not mean you will; ie a woman who\u2019s had a hysterectomy is female because the uterus is a female sex organ. Excludes women without gametes. Excludes women born without uterus. Nice one. Tell me. Do sexists ask you nicely what is in your pants before opressing you? Do misogynists ask for your birth certificate before being misogynistic? Or do they do that based solely on THEIR perception of you? six year olds should have segregated bathrooms because adults have segregated bathrooms, Adults also have alcohol and tobacco. Adults also have driver licenses and cars. Dumb. And literally teaching children they\u2019re different based on their genitals, and belong to different categories that should never mix. THAT is upholding gender roles. YOU are doing that. Do you\u2026 do I need to ask about segregated bathrooms in other contexts or\u2026 and children aren\u2019t as innocent as you\u2019d think. i know countless friends who were assaulted by male classmates when they were very young. Did they need to identify as girls first or did they just do it as boys? And your solution is\u2026 to check every girls genitals before she is allowed into the bathroom? Or what? Patriarchy sucks. It teaches boys from a young age that they are superior to girls, that they hold power over them and are allowed to. That they have right to their bodies. That\u2019s wrong. And literally what we\u2019re fighting. We want agency over our own bodies, and every child, every adult to live in peace, and comfortable in their bodies. I could look up the statistics on how trans people, especially girls and women, are much more likely to be assaulted the to be the assailant. But I know it\u2019s useless, you wouldn\u2019t read it, because you don\u2019t care. You have your set belief and no amount of evidence to the contrary will ever change them. So I won\u2019t bother with sources anymore (oh hey! Sources! The thing YOU promised ME. How we looking? Are you still gonna show them or) also, humans are not boats. Good job! Now go and explain to @terfclairenovak that humans are also not plants! for the opposite sex\u2019s reproductive organs/system. And? So what? If you don\u2019t reduce a woman to her reproductive organs, why should that matter? How is that useful in day to day life? Do you ask every woman you meet in a public restroom whether she was born with the capability of developing female reproductive organs? To determine whether she\u2019s allowed in? Or are you maybe judging based on presentation? How\u2019s that working out for you?

Having two X chromosomes does not turn you into a goshdamned Barbie doll with no junk or libido. Men objectify women. Women objectify women. Women objectify men. Men objectify men.

There are few things that have pissed me off as much as this dumbass thread. Fucking damnit, May feels like a year already and it\u2019s only 12:23. I shouldn\u2019t have to explain this to you, but people are allowed to objectify themselves. Men are allowed to objectify themselves. Women are allowed to objectify themselves. It becomes wrong when that\u2019s being done to the opposite sex so consistently. There\u2019s a difference between someone doing it on their own, versus having it done to them nonconsenually. Men have objectified women since the dawn of time. I\u2019m not saying women never objectify men, but only recently has it started being done on a very public, very open, very wide-scale. Not sure what you\u2019re not getting. People are allowed to objectify themselves, but shouldn\u2019t be doing it to others unless they have said it\u2019s okay. Women beginning to actively do it to men and dismissing it as a joke, like they do, is spinning it on its head and putting them in our shoes, to help them understand why it can be frustrating. This is something women have experienced on a daily basis for centuries. I don\u2019t mean to sound like I\u2019m encouraging any type of sexism, but what we\u2019ve been doing up until this point has changed absolutely nothing, so this is a nice change of pace. if you can\u2019t see how recently calling men lawnmowers and wallets is payback for men calling us dishwashers and housewives our entire lives, you never cared about objectifcation or being equal in the first place. Also, can we talk about how men doing those things (working/taking care of the lawn/etc) are a product of misogyny? It has changed a bit now, but for the longest time women weren\u2019t allowed to work so they depended financially on men, now that we\u2019ve decided to do exactly that (we really don\u2019t that\u2019s the whole point), they have a problem with it. They are only okay with it if it means they can control women but the moment we step up and \u201caccept\u201d and reclaim the situation, they suddenly realize they are not in control anymore and call it \u201cmisandry\u201d. Men were the \u201cstrong ones\u201d, as opposed to women who were the \u201cweak and delicate ones\u201d, so they took care of the lawn and fixed stuff around the house because \u201cwomen belonged in the kitchen\u201d. Now they are angry that we tell them they \u201cbelong\u201d doing what they were CHOOSING to do all along. The difference between women calling men \u201clawnmowers\u201d and \u201cwallets\u201d and men saying women \u201cbelong in the kitchen\u201d and \u201cshould always be polite and keep their mouth shut\u201d is (besides the fact that it is a fucking joke to make misogynist men angry) that men were never oppressed by women into doing those things in the first place, and they never had to fight to not do those things and be able to express themselves, and work, and vote and be in an environment they chose to be in, because for men, THAT WAS ALWAYS A CHOICE. If you can\u2019t understand this basic concept and think that women are misandrists for doing to you what you have done to women for ages AS A JOKE, then you are the one that is denser than uranium and about as reactive as lead.

The Countess, speaking at the United Nations in New York, said life has already regressed for women and girls in Afghanistan, dismissing the Taliban\u2019s claims that they were letting them continue their lives freely as \u201cnot true\u201d. \u201cIt is so hard to imagine how much has changed for so many in so little time,\u201d she told delegates. \u201cWhere once there was hope, with women playing a central role in society, there is now hunger, destitution and violence. \"And now our attention is at risk of being diverted from Afghanistan, with the devastating invasion of Ukraine by its Russian neighbour. \"But while our focus has naturally turned to these events, the crisis in Afghanistan has not gone away, and the effects are worsening daily.\u201d The Countess spoke at the Upholding Women\u2019s Rights In Afghanistan meeting in her long-term role with the Women, Peace and Security (WPS) agenda. She joined UN Women representatives and NGOs at a briefing, led by the UK Mission to New York, on the impact of the conflict in Ukraine on women and girls. Describing her recent conversation with an Afghan translator who left his homeland in 2014, the Countess said he had been \u201calmost in tears\u201d while speaking of his female relatives still there. \u201cMost of them dare not even go out of their houses at all, terrified of being taken, abused, or worse,\u201d she said, calling them \u201cvirtual prisoners in their own homes\u201d. \u201cLife has regressed, yet the Taliban would have us believe that they are allowing citizens to go about their normal activities,\u201d she said. \u201cWe know that this is not true. \"So while we welcome their announcement that they have committed to re-opening schools to girls this month, and the return of some women to university, what we know is that the rights of women and girls have worsened.\u201d She added: \u201cAfghanistan is facing a desperate humanitarian and economic crisis.\u201d The Countess is spending four days on a solo working trip to New York, where she appeared at the UN as well as taking part in engagements promoting gender equality in the workplace. To mark Commonwealth Day, she visited the Queen Elizabeth II Garden which celebrates the historic ties of friendship between the US, UK and Commonwealth, and attended a reception with leaders. source: https://www.telegraph.co.uk/royal-family/2022/03/15/sophie-countess-wessex-crisis-afghanistans-women-worse-ever/?utm_content=telegraph&utm_medium=Social&utm_campaign=Echobox&utm_source=Twitter#Echobox=1647378795-1", "target": "None"}, "139": {"text": "ommunismkills: \u201cI hate Western civilization.\u201d, writes the gender-queer blogger who posts about his drug usage, promiscuity, and homosexuality, not understanding he would certainly get stoned to death in any non-Westernized nation.
